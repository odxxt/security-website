## üöÄ About This Project

This portfolio is more than just a static page; it's an interactive experience designed to reflect my passion for cybersecurity, computer engineering, and creative development. The core concept revolves around a functional web-based terminal where visitors can interact with the site using familiar commands. It also incorporates various JavaScript-driven features and animations for a dynamic feel.

The goal was to create a memorable portfolio that not only displays my work but also demonstrates my technical skills in frontend development and creative problem-solving.
